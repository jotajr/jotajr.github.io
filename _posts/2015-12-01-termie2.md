I have been using [Termie](http://termie.sourceforge.net/) for for a while before, as far as I can remember during my old university days. It's a simple RS232 terminal program, originally developed by David McClurg in 2008. Termie is a clone of [Termite from ITB CompuPhase](http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm). It is a useful program to monitor a serial port connection or log an output data from a RS232 communication device.

I have made a little touchup to Termie's source code with few enhancements as the original project development has stopped and no update since May 2008. So, here comes the "Termie2" then. Not much deal.
