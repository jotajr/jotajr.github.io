Another EXIF Reader is an improved version of Exif Reader application that I have developed during the last year which is called [Simple Exif Reader](https://heiswayi.github.io/2016/simple-exif-reader-application). The purpose of Another EXIF Reader is straightforward i.e. to extract metadadata or read EXIF data of an image file, especially in photography related works. Technically, Another EXIF Reader is developed in .NET C# using WPF (code-behind only) and awesome [MetadataExtractor](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-dotnet) library. Another EXIF Reader is a freeware and open source.
